# tasks.md -- pm-zero v9.4 Execution Ledger

## Goal Binding
- Vision source: docs/vision.md
- Active goal: Maintain World Emotion Map under pm-zero v9.4 without changing product code.
- Planning owner: Codex CLI
- Implementation owner: Codex CLI
- Review owner: Codex CLI self-audit

## Status Vocabulary
- proposed: idea exists, not ready
- ready: owner, dependencies, write scope, acceptance, verification, and expected evidence are clear
- doing: one owner is actively working
- blocked: needs decision, dependency, credential, environment, or human action
- review: implementation complete, review pending
- done: accepted by reviewer
- verified: evidence recorded

## Parallelization Rules
- Coordinator owns tasks.md.
- Worker agents own only their assigned Write Scope.
- Parallel implementation requires disjoint Write Scopes or isolated worktrees.
- If two tasks need the same file, serialize them.
- Subagents return reports; coordinator updates tasks.md.

## Tasks
| ID | Status | Owner | Depends On | Write Scope | Acceptance | Verification | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T001 | verified | Codex CLI | none | AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, HANDOFF-JA.md, tasks.md, docs/, scripts/setup.mjs, scripts/verify.mjs, .claude/settings.json, .gitignore | pm-zero v9.4 source-of-truth files exist, generated worktrees/local tools are ignored, and product code is untouched | git diff --check; node scripts/verify.mjs | 2026-05-17: node scripts/verify.mjs passed; git diff --check passed before commit. |
