# Project AGENTS.md -- pm-zero v9.4

## Language
- Completion reports, error reports, and manual confirmation requests: Japanese.
- Code identifiers and command names: English.
- When 3+ HIGH assumptions accumulate, ask immediately.

## Source of Truth
- Product intent: docs/vision.md, which points to the retained root vision.md product spec.
- Execution tasks: tasks.md
- Current state: docs/state.md
- Decisions: docs/decisions.md
- Failures: docs/issues.md
- Repository map: docs/repo-map.md
- Report: HANDOFF-JA.md

## Startup Read
- Read this file.
- Read docs/state.md.
- Read docs/decisions.md.
- Read docs/repo-map.md Summary.

## Repository Navigation
- Read detailed repo-map sections only when target files are unclear.
- Update docs/repo-map.md after structural changes.
- Use rg before broad manual browsing.

## Task Ledger Rule
- Planning output goes to tasks.md.
- Implementation starts from tasks marked ready.
- Each ready task includes owner, dependencies, write scope, acceptance, verification, and evidence.
- Coordinator updates tasks.md.
- Worker agents report results to the coordinator.

## Scope Lock Rule
- One coordinator owns tasks.md and docs/state.md.
- Workers edit only their assigned write scope.
- Parallel work requires disjoint Write Scopes or isolated worktrees.
- Tasks touching the same file are serialized.

## Quality Standards
- Keep files and functions small enough to review.
- Generated worktrees, caches, service-account keys, and secrets must stay ignored.
- Product code changes require an explicit task in tasks.md.
- Auth, DB schema, RLS/permissions, deploy, security, and external API changes require critical review.

## Commands
- install: pnpm install
- lint: pnpm lint
- build: pnpm build
- verify: node scripts/verify.mjs
- setup: node scripts/setup.mjs

Use only commands that exist in this repository.

## Execution Boundaries
- Use PowerShell.
- Use standard push with branch tracking.
- Keep safe values only in output.
- Use .env.local.example as template; runtime reads actual env values.
- API keys, service accounts, Supabase secrets, deploy, and X posting approval are human tasks.

## Git Workflow

### Branches
- Never commit directly to `main`. Always work on a dedicated branch.
- Naming: `<type>/<short-description>` — e.g. `feat/add-auth`, `fix/null-check`, `docs/update-readme`, `security/harden-gitignore`.
- Create the branch at the start of the task, not after implementation.

### Commits
- Commit after each logically complete unit of work. Do not accumulate changes and commit at session end.
- Format: `<type>: <short description>` — types: `feat` / `fix` / `docs` / `refactor` / `security` / `chore` / `test`.
- Stage only files within the task's Write Scope. Never stage `.env*`, secrets, or credential files.
- Every committed function must work. No placeholder code.

### Push
- Push after every commit. Do not leave commits local-only.
- First push: `git push -u origin <branch>`. Subsequent: `git push`.

### Pull Requests
- Open a PR to `main` when the branch is complete. Do not wait for the user to ask.
- PR title: conventional commit format matching the branch type.
- PR body: what changed and why.

### Pre-push Security Check
- Confirm `.gitignore` covers secret and credential patterns before the first push on any branch.
- Run `gitleaks git --no-banner` if gitleaks is available.
- If secrets are staged, untrack them and update `.gitignore` before pushing.
